# PTT Post Tracker
This app is an Chrome Extension which can save PTT web links and categorize them through different boards. Here is the link:

## How to Use it
Video Coming Soon...
### Adding a link to the extension
Go to any PTT web link e.g. this [NBA board link](https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/NBA/M.1502408741.A.122.html). When you are on that page, simply click on the extension icon and you will have the link saved inside the board name.

### Deleting a link
Go to the link you want to delete and drag the link to the trash can to delete the link.

### Deleting a board
Same with deleting a link, except you drag the board instead of dragging the link.

### Delete everything
***Warning: This will delete everything you have saved!***
 
Just hit the `Delete All` button!
